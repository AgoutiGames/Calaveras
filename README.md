# Calaveras
A little game about a jumping frog. Click, drag and release to let the frog jump in a specific direction. There is only one level and no goal. This was originally just a prototype for an university course but is now also used for testing new features like the very recent [Web Build](https://vector-wolf.itch.io/calaveras). What holds this project back is the missing android build of the engine since the game was originally meant as a smartphone app with touch controls.
## Compile and install
* Generally you can just use the bash scripts in the [scripts folder](/scripts)
* See [COMPILATION](/COMPILATION) for details
